# Fall Guys Database
A database for everything related to Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout! This will be used by [FallGuys.org](https://fallguys.org) for stuff like the wiki and cosmetic tracker.

You can use this database in your own apps, but *please*, do these two things if you use it:
1. 👉 Link to this repo in your app's credits or README
2. 👉 Contribute to the database over time. This will be very much appreciated by everyone! ❤️

## What's in this database?
* Customisation Items (pattern, costumes, emotes, etc)
  * Currency
  * Item Source
  * Item Type
  * Rarity
* Seasons
* Rounds
  * Round Type

More entities will be added whenever it makes sense to do so.

## How do I use it?
It's up to you! We use JSON for data sets so that it's easy to adapt for any purpose. That being said, you can use [Fall Guys SQL Database Generator](https://github.com/FallGuys-org/SqlDatabaseGenerator) to generate a SQLite db.

The C# models are available [here](https://github.com/FallGuys-org/SqlDatabaseGenerator/tree/main/src/FGO.Database/Models).
